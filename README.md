## Emerging Technologies Project
###### Written by Ervin Mamutov

For my emerging technologies module in college I built this application and named it 808. The specification of the project was to be to train a Neural Network(NN) using a popular library such as Tensorflow and use that trained NN to predict the what number is present on a file passed in from a front end web application.

This repository holds my solution to this project specification.

### How to use this repository

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x, Jupyter, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy and Git installed locally. (I'd recommend using Anaconda to install the python packages required to run this.)
2. Enter the following commands into your command line.
```bash
# Change directory to anywhere you desire
cd anywhere..

# Clone this repository using git
git clone https://github.com/ImErvin/Emerging-Technologies.git
cd Emergin-Technologies

# Install the node_modules using npm install
npm install

# Run the server
py app.py

# Now open your browser on localhost/5000 (For best results - use a modern browser)

```
